# Algorithm for knight’s tour in Python

- One of the interesting puzzlers for chess buffs is the
  Knight's Tour problem, originally proposed by the mathematician Euler.
  The question is: Can the chess piece called the knight move around
  an empty chessboard and touch each of the 64 squares once and only once?

- To solve, this program uses Warnsdorf's rule http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour

- An array 9x9 will be created to simulate the chessboard, subscript 0 will
  be reserved for further development. Put a 1 in the first square you move
  to, a 2 in the second square, a 3 in the third...

- Each potential move will be tested to make sure it doesn't land off the
  board and doesn't revisit the old move.

- This program will use accessibility heuristic. Accessibility of a square
  will be equal precisely to the number of squares from which that square
  may be reached. At any time, the knight should move to the square with
  the lowest accessibility.

- When encountering a tie in accessibility between two or more squares,
  decides what square to choose by looking ahead to those squares reachable
  from the "tied" squares. The program should move to the square for which
  the next move would arrive at a square with the lowest accessibility number.
